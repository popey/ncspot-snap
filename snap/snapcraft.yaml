summary: Cross-platform ncurses Spotify client written in Rust
description: |
  ncurses Spotify client written in Rust using librespot. It is heavily 
  inspired by ncurses MPD clients, such as ncmpc. My motivation was to 
  provide a simple and resource friendly alternative to the official 
  client as well as to support platforms that currently don't have a 
  Spotify client, such as the *BSDs.
