summary: Cross-platform ncurses Spotify client written in Rust
description: |
    ncurses Spotify client written in Rust using librespot. It is heavily
    inspired by ncurses MPD clients, such as ncmpc. My motivation was to
    provide a simple and resource friendly alternative to the official
    client as well as to support platforms that currently don't have a
    Spotify client, such as the *BSDs.
